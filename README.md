# Geeky Hawks React Native UI Components

**Build consistent, theme-aware React Native apps faster.**

A lightweight and reusable React Native UI components library — providing not just components, but also an optional theming system (colors, spacing, typography) for building consistent designs in your React Native apps.  

All components can be used **individually without the ThemeProvider** — just pass your own colors, styles, or props directly.  
The **Theme System** is entirely optional but helps maintain a unified look and easily supports light/dark modes.

Includes **StatusBar**, **AppBar**, **Text**, **TextInput**, **FloatingLabelTextInput**, **Button**, **Radio**, **CheckBox**, **Switch**, **ActivityIndicator**, **LoaderModal**, and more — fully typed with TypeScript, theme-ready, and easy to integrate into any React Native project.

✨ Developed & Maintained by [Geeky Hawks](https://www.geekyhawks.com).

## 🚀 Get Started

### 1. Install

```bash
# npm
npm install @geekyhawks/react-native-ui-components

# yarn
yarn add @geekyhawks/react-native-ui-components
```

### 2. Wrap your app with ThemeProvider (optional, but recommended)

Using the `ThemeProvider` is **optional** — all components can be used directly and styled via props.

However, wrapping your app with the `ThemeProvider` allows you to:

- Define theme colors, fonts, and spacing in one place  
- Easily [switch between light and dark modes](https://github.com/GeekyHawks/react-native-ui-components/blob/main/docs/Theme.md#with-light--dark-mode)  
- Ensure consistent styling across all components  

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@geekyhawks/react-native-ui-components";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      {/* Your App Components (HomeScreen, AppNavigator, NavigationContainer, etc.) */}
      <HomeScreen />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

If you choose to use the `ThemeProvider`, make sure it wraps your entire app (usually in `App.tsx`), so that all components can access the theme consistently.

If you don’t use the `ThemeProvider`, simply pass custom styles or colors directly to each component.

### 3. Use a component

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { ActivityIndicator, AppBar, Button, CheckBox, FloatingLabelTextInput, Radio, RadioGroup, StatusBar, Switch, Text, TextInput } from "@geekyhawks/react-native-ui-components";

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const [selectedValue, setSelectedValue] = useState<string | number>("apple");
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);
  const [allowed, setAllowed] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <StatusBar />

      <AppBar title="Home" />

      <Text>Hello, World! 👋</Text>

      <Text variant="h1">Heading Text</Text>

      <TextInput
        label="Name"
        placeholder="John Doe"
        onChangeText={(text) => {
          // Do something with text
        }}
      />

      <FloatingLabelTextInput
        label="Email Address"
        keyboardType="email-address"
        autoCapitalize="none"
        onChangeText={(text) => {
          // Do something with text
        }}
      />

      <RadioGroup selectedValue={selectedValue} onValueChange={setSelectedValue}>
        <Radio value="apple" label="Apple" />
        <Radio value="banana" label="Banana" />
        <Radio value="orange" label="Orange" />
      </RadioGroup>

      <CheckBox
        value="terms"
        label="I agree to the Terms & Conditions"
        selectedValues={checked ? ["terms"] : []}
        onChange={(_, isChecked) => setChecked(isChecked)}
      />

      <Switch
        value={allowed}
        onValueChange={setAllowed}
        label="Enable notifications"
      />

      <ActivityIndicator
        text="Please wait..."
        textPosition="right"
        textColor={"primary"}
        variant="large" />

      <Button onPress={() => console.log("Pressed!")}>
        Default Button
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## ❤️ Support our Open Source Work

**They say AI is writing the code now.** While AI is incredible at generating snippets, it often struggles with the high-stakes reality of React Native: **consistent theming, design-system integrity, and scalable UI architecture.** At **Geeky Hawks**, we don't just build components; we build the **standardized foundations** that AI needs to be truly effective. This library ensures your UI remains consistent, theme-aware, and production-ready—no matter how the code was generated.

If this library has helped you **standardize your UI or saved you the tedious work of manual styling**, consider supporting our mission. Your sponsorship fuels the development of the next generation of AI-native developer tools.
